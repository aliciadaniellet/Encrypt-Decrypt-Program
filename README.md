# Encrypt-Decrypt-Program

Cipher is an encryption/decryption tool capable of processing both text and binary files. It employs a modified book cipher technique and uses bitwise operations and XOR encoding, in C language, drawing upon a sequence of bytes from a designated 'book' file, which can be any text or binary file.
